Staking on LPs differ from traditional staking on-chain staking in the following ways:

* Use have to stake both BZE and OSMO in equal amounts.&#x20;

&#x20;        As in you want to stake 1000 BZE you also have to stake 1.68 Osmosis.&#x20;

* Also in Osmosis there are two Levels of LP staking&#x20;

1.  Level 1: In this stage, you earn rewards through swap fees. The current APR is 3.38%. By participating, you benefit from transaction fees generated by users swapping tokens.

2. Level 2: In this stage, you can stake your coins for a longer period to earn a higher APR. This concept is known as Bonded Liquidity. By locking in your coins, you receive better rewards over time as a result of your commitment.
