Let's go about the page to understand all the terms and how to use them :smile:

* **5% Inflation**: This indicates the annual rate at which new BZE tokens are created.
* **21 days Unbonding Time**: This refers to the period required to unbond or unstake tokens before they can be withdrawn or used elsewhere.
* **5% Double Sign Slashing**: This indicates the penalty (in percentage) for validators if they are caught signing two different blocks at the same height, which is a form of misbehavior.
* **0.01% Downtime Slashing**: This represents the penalty (in percentage) for validators if they are offline or not available to validate transactions for a certain period.

* **Voting Power**: The amount of BZE staked with the validator, indicating their influence in the network’s governance.
* **24H Changes**: The change in the validator’s voting power in the last 24 hours.
* **Commission**: The percentage of rewards that the validator takes as a fee for their services.

{% hint style="info" %}
The "Delegate" button next to each validator allows users to delegate their BZE tokens to that validator, contributing to their voting power and potentially earning staking rewards.
{% endhint %}
