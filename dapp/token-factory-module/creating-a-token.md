#### Metadata Section

* **Status**: "Not verified" indicates that the metadata for the token is not yet verified.&#x20;
* **Base denomination**: Displays the unique identifier for the token in the format `factory/testbz1dvp8us2s7hh4ufwcu28wm....fcmunw/1000`.&#x20;

#### Token Details Section

* **Name**: This field is intended for the name of the token (example given: BeeZee)
* **Ticker/Symbol**: This field is for the token's symbol (example given: BZE).
* **Decimals/Exponent**: Decimals in cryptocurrency refer to the fractional units of a cryptocurrency.&#x20;
* **Token's description**: This field is intended for a description of the token.

The details mentioned above are very basic, but they are crucial to enter because they contain information that all users who are interested in the token will see. Therefore, it is crucial that you fill them out accurately.

**You can use the edit but to enter the details mentioned above.**

#### Minting and Burning Section

* **Mint/Burn Buttons**: The buttons to mint or burn tokens are disabled until the metadata is completed.

From here, you can burn coins from the supply or mint new ones. To increase the quantity of coins, more are made through minting. A minting and burning check is essential to ensure that the supply is calculated based on the design and use case of your tokens.

#### Admin Section

* **Admin Actions**: Options to "Give Up Ownership" or "Transfer Ownership" are provided for the admin address.
* **Warning**: Notes that this address has the power to mint, burn tokens, and change token metadata, indicating the need for caution.

{% hint style="warning" %}
metadata should be added to the token to display its human-readable details throughout the application. This metadata needs to be completed before minting or burning actions can be performed.
{% endhint %}
