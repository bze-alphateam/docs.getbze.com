You can find a list of all the assets listed on BeeZee Blockchain created using our token factory module.&#x20;

You click "Details" to find more useful information regarding the token , like total supply , Admin address.

Additionally, the token's verification status is available. Based on the authenticity and honesty of the information supplied by the owners, the BeeZee team will update the status of the verification. It isn't determined by money or trading volume of the project.&#x20;

We adopt a strategy to cut down on the time and energy that numerous tokens waste trying to get verified by different organizations.&#x20;

We understand this struggle, as we too lack millions of dollars and are therefore "unverified" or have "incomplete details" on numerous platforms.&#x20;

However, on our platform, getting verified is simple, easy, and not frustrating.
