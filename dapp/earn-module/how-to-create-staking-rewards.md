# How to create staking Rewards

Anyone using the Dapp can create staking rewards can be created by anyone with any two tokens or the same token (for stake and as reward).

For example, someone creating a staking reward chooses BZE as the coins for the stake and VDL as the reward. User entering the pool will need to stake BZE to earn VDL.

Daily Reward : As the name suggest the Daily Rewards for pool, following the above example we choose VDL as the reward coin.

Reward Duration : The no of days the pools will be live for

Staking coin : According the example we choose staking coin as BZE , and also you can also define the minimun stake for pool&#x20;

Unstake lock :  An input field where the user can specify the number of days the staked amount will be locked before it can be unstaked.

This form allows users to configure the details of the staking rewards they want to create, including the reward amount, the duration of the reward, the type of coins involved, and the conditions for staking and unstaking.
