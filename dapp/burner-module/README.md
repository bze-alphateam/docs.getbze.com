# Burner Module

As the name "Burner Module" implies, this is used for burning BZE. It makes it easier for users of BZE to actively participate in burning as it removes many hassles associated with burning.

With just a click of a button, a specific amount of BZE entered by the user can be burned.

The burning of BZE is also supported by various methods that have been incorporated into our blockchain. These are :arrow\_heading\_down:

1. Market Buy Back: We plan to buy back BZE on a monthly basis and use it to fund the burning module. The amount will range from a few dollars to several hundred dollars, depending on our operating expenses and income . These trades will be made gradually throughout the month to avoid having a significant impact on prices or giving arbitrage traders an advantage.
2. Trading Fees: Fees collected on Trade Module that is collected from users is sent to the burner module. &#x20;
3. 3\. Community pool: Funds for this pool come from various taxes collected by the blockchain for using different features, such as market pair creation, token creation, staking rewards, and trading rewards.&#x20;
