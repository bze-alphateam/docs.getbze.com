# Burning Raffle

As the name suggests, it's an easy-to-use raffle system built on Beezee.&#x20;

Users can navigate to the Burner module to quickly check if a raffle is open.&#x20;

In the image below, you can see a raffle is currently open with a prize pool exceeding 100k BZE.

You can also see all the other major and minor details like&#x20;

* **Ticket Price :** 25 BZE
* **Chances :** 1 out of 10,000 : The odds of winning per ticket out of 10,000 tickets.
* **Time Remaining  :** 12 days
* Winners and Total BZE won that is currently 0.

Users can buy tickets to enter the raffle, with each ticket adding to the pot. After two blocks, the blockchain checks if the ticket is a winner. If so, the user wins a portion of the pot, while the rest remains locked for future prizes.

{% hint style="warning" %}
All raffles have a set end date. When a raffle ends, any unclaimed pot is burned, with the amount and block height recorded on the blockchain and shown in the "Burner" section of the BZE app.

Afterward, your wallet will ask you to approve the transaction. Once approved, the ticket price (25 BZE in this case) will be deducted from your wallet.

As you can see you have to wait for 8-15 sec while the blockchain decides if you are a winner.

Unfortunately, I didnâ€™t win this time, as you can see from the image.
