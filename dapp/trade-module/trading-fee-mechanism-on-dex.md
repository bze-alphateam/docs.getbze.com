These orders remain on the order book, waiting for other traders to match them. By placing these orders, market makers contribute to a smoother trading experience, giving buyers and sellers more options.

**Market Taker :** A market taker is someone who buys or sells an asset at its current market price. They place orders that are instantly matched with existing market orders, essentially "taking" available orders. This role is critical for the quick execution of trades, which makes the market more dynamic and responsive.
