#### Market Coin

The base coin is the first currency listed in a trading pair and is the asset being traded. For example, in the trading pair VDL/BZE, VDL is the base coin. When you create a market or place an order, you are either buying or selling this base coin (VDL) against the quote coin.&#x20;

Users can select the market coin by clicking the "+ Pick coin" button.

#### Quote Coin

The quote coin is the second currency listed in a trading pair and is used to price the base coin. For instance, in the trading pair VDL/BZE, BZE is the quote coin. The price of the base coin (VDL) is expressed in terms of the quote coin (BZE). In other words, it shows how much of the quote coin is needed to purchase one unit of the base coin.&#x20;

**Action Buttons**
